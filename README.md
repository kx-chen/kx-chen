### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

A bit about me:
* Second year student at the University of British Columbia
* Incoming SWE Intern at SAP
* Previous SWE Intern at Later and Hootsuite

I'm also a huge believer in open source. 

Previously, I was a MLH Fellow where I contributed to open source Python projects such as Flask, Werkzeug, Click, FastAPI and more. In 2018, I also [participated](https://kx-chen-gci-blog.netlify.app/tasks/) and won Google Code-In, a programming contest where high school students contribute to open source software.
